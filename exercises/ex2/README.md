## Exercise 2

In this exercise we will introduce you to Workflow Intelligence capability of Workflow Management using Data Attribute Recommender service. 
Using Workflow Intelligence, Business Owners and citizen developer can configure a machine learning based scenarios. Workflow Intelligence scenario can generate recommendation for Approvers as confidence levels.

*Make sure you have fulfilled the prerequisites listed in the main [README](/README.md).*

The exercise is realized as a [Jupyter notebook](./TechEdINT360-WorkflowIntelligence.ipynb).

### Executing the Jupyter Notebook

There are two options: running the notebook locally or running it on a cloud service.

#### Executing the Notebook directly in the browser

The easiest way to get started with Jupyter is to launch the
notebook directly in your browser via [mybinder.org].

[mybinder.org]: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/SAP-samples/teched2021-INT360/main?labpath=exercises%2Fex2%2FTechEdINT360-WorkflowIntelligence.ipynb
It may take up to five minutes to launch the notebook. Sessions on this free service
can be terminated after a [10 minutes of inactivity]. Make sure not to leave the
browser window for long periods of time and download your notebook once you
are done with the workshop for safekeeping.

If the main link above does not work for you and the notebook is not launching
even after five minutes, you can directly try one of the
[fallback options](https://binderhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/federation/federation.html):
[Binderhub], [OVH] or [GESIS].

If you prefer, the notebook is also available on [Google Colab] after prior login.

Once you have launched the notebook, you are all set.
The remaining workshop content is located inside the notebook.

#### Executing the Notebook locally

If you prefer to run the notebook locally, we have a separate set of instructions for a docker based setup. Use TechEdINT360-WorkflowIntelligence.ipynb file name in the following instructions to open exercise 2 notebook locally
